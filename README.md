# Computer-System-Design-Fundamentals :computer:

The basic assignments suggested on the NPTEL course fundamnetals of computer system design.
The course uses a hardware simulator from the website https://www.nand2tetris.org/software.
Goal of the course is to create a complete computer system using just the universal NAND gate.

Book to follow : The Elements of Computing Systems - Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken

## 1: Basic Gates in Hardware Simulator

NOT, AND, OR, NOR, XOR Gates using the universal NAND gate. The code is written in .hdl files that represent basic chip files in the hardware simulator

## 2: Operations using basic gates

Multiplexer and De-multiplexer using the basic gates created previously.

## 3: Boolean Arithmetic 

Using Basic gate and Multiplexers created before create arithmetic devices: Half Adder, Incrementer 16 bit, Full Adder, ALU.

## 4: Multi Way Gates

Building MUX 8 way, DMUX 8 and 4 way, Or gate 8 way.

## 5: Mulit Input and Output Aggregates 

MUX and DMUX 4 way 16 and 8 way 16.
